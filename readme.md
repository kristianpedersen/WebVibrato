# WebVibrato

Do you also lack a pitch/mod wheel? 
WebVibrato takes care of it by moving the pitchbend wheel for you when you press a key.

Note: It's easier to adjust WebVibrato when your synth's pitch bend range has a low value like -2 semitones.

WebVibrato was made using [WebMidi.js](https://github.com/cotejp/webmidi)
